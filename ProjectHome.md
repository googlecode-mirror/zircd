Built on PHP-IRCd, zIRCd is a PHP IRCd programmed just for fun by a couple of the staff at www.zimbaka.com

We've made it use mySQL to store data unlike other IRCds, and that's because we want to be different.

Test server (if it's up): bolton.irc.me.uk:6661 #zIRCd

Please make sure that you report any bugs you find by using the 'Issues' tab.
